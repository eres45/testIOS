# Testing & Adaptation Documentation

This document outlines the testing strategy and device adaptations implemented in the SingleScreenApp.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests

The app includes unit tests for key service components:

- **UserServiceTests**: Tests the UserService class by mocking the network layer
  - `testCreateUserSuccess`: Tests successful user creation
  - `testCreateUserNetworkError`: Tests handling of network errors
  - `testFetchUserSuccess`: Tests successful user fetch
  - `testFetchUserNotFound`: Tests handling of 404 errors

### 2. Network Testing

The app has been designed to handle various network conditions:

- **Success Cases**: Normal API interactions with successful responses
- **Error Cases**: Handling of HTTP errors (401, 404, 500, etc.)
- **No Connection**: Special UI and recovery for offline state
- **Timeout Handling**: Graceful recovery from timeout situations

### 3. Interface Testing

The UI has been tested across multiple scenarios:

- **Form Validation**: Testing validation of email fields
- **Loading States**: Testing loading indicator display
- **Success States**: Testing display of success responses
- **Error States**: Testing error message display
- **Network Loss**: Testing offline mode display and recovery

## Device Adaptations

### 1. Screen Size Adaptations

The app uses responsive design principles to adapt to different device sizes:

- **iPhone SE (Small)**: Optimized layouts with reduced padding and font sizes
- **Standard iPhones**: Balanced design for most common screen sizes
- **iPhone Pro Max (Large)**: Expanded layouts with larger spacing and elements

### 2. Adaptive Components

Several components automatically adapt to the device size:

- `adaptiveSpacing()`: Adjusts spacing between elements
- `adaptivePadding()`: Adjusts padding within containers
- `adaptiveFont()`: Scales font sizes appropriately
- `adaptiveImageSize()`: Adjusts image dimensions
- `adaptiveIconSize()`: Scales icon sizes

### 3. Dark Mode Support

Full dark mode implementation with:

- Dynamic color system that responds to system appearance changes
- Custom neumorphic designs for both light and dark appearances
- Contrast-appropriate text and UI elements
- Dark-mode specific shadows and highlights

### 4. Dynamic Type Support

Text elements respond to system font size settings:

- Proper font scaling using the system's text styles
- Appropriate line height and spacing adjustments
- Readable text at all sizes

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully across the following test scenarios:

1. ✅ User creation with valid input
2. ✅ User creation with network failure
3. ✅ User fetching with successful response
4. ✅ User fetching with 404 error
5. ✅ App usage without network connectivity
6. ✅ UI rendering across all supported device sizes
7. ✅ Dark mode appearance correctness
