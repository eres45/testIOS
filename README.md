## 🏗️ Architecture

This app implements the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:

- **Models**: Data structures that match API responses
- **Views**: SwiftUI views responsible only for UI presentation
- **ViewModels**: Business logic, state management, and data processing
- **Services**: API interaction and data handling

## 🌐 API Integration

The app integrates with the [ReqRes](https://reqres.in) API for demonstration purposes:

- `POST /api/users` - Create user
- `GET /api/users/{id}` - Fetch user by ID

## 🧪 Testing

Run the tests in Xcode:

1. Select Product > Test (⌘+U)
2. View test results in the Test Navigator

## 📝 Notes for New Developers

- Explore the ViewModels to understand state management
- Check the Services directory to see proper API implementation
- Review the UI components in the Views directory for SwiftUI examples
- The Utilities folder contains helpful extensions and components
